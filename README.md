# Survey App

A new Synapsis Challenge Test.

## Notes
- The remember me feature has been implemented by default where users cannot uncheck the checkbox on the login page
- When the user has finished or submitted the survey. What happens is that the application only prints the survey results that have been filled in by the user on the debug console
- The application cannot handle survey questions in the form of multi checkboxes
- The Question Numbering Pop up feature has not been implemented properly. The pop up can only display the numbers in the survey without the ability to receive actions from the user
